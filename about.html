                    RPI is a constant vortex of hard courses, state-of-the-art research and large scale projects.
                    However, in a community of thousands of intelligent individuals, even finding people who share
                    the same interests with you

                    Whether you're organizing a pop-up art sale, finding a partner to cram in
                    some last-minute PHYS 1200 before an exam, or even finding people to participate in a basic 
                    discussion or debate, can be harder than it seems.
