# Resonance 🎵

*A music-focused social platform for RPI students*

## What is Resonance?

Resonance is a web application created to solve a problem that has been frustrating me (as well as most musicians at RPI) and that is: finding someone to jam with is much harder than it seems like. 

It is just like that, you leave a comment in some group chat, and then you get 2 replies and half of the time people miss their appointments. Besides, how should you even know the level of skills of a person or even whether they are listening to the same kind of genres as you are?

Resonance makes everything permanent by being a committed place where musicians of RPI can meet and work with each other.

## Features 🚀

- **Smart Matching**: AI algorithm that actually matches you with people who share your music taste and availability
- **Post & Find**: Create posts for practice sessions, collaborations, or performances. No more buried messages in group chats!
- **Real-time Chat**: Seamless communication with your matches
- **Event Integration**: Sync with your academic calendar and discover campus events
- **Quiz System**: 2-minute quiz to find your musical "resonance" with other students

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern animations and responsive design
- **Fonts**: Hyperiot (custom display font) + Inter (body text)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Background**: Animated GIF from Giphy (because why not make it fun?)
- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript with ES6 imports

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone this repo (or just download the files)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it! No build process, no dependencies, just pure web magic ✨

## Design Philosophy 🎨

I wanted this to feel like a modern music platform, not just another boring website. So I went with:

- **Vibrant colors**: Orange gradients that pop and feel energetic
- **Custom typography**: Hyperiot font for that futuristic, music-tech vibe
- **Animated backgrounds**: Because static is boring
- **Smooth interactions**: Hover effects, transitions, the works
- **Mobile-first**: Works great on phones (because that's where students live)

## Key Sections 📱

- **Hero**: Big, bold "Connect, Collaborate, Create" with animated background
- **Quiz CTA**: "Discover your campus' music scene!" - gets people engaged
- **Problem/Solution**: Explains why Resonance exists and how it helps
- **Features**: Shows off the cool stuff the platform does
- **Login/Signup**: Modal-based authentication (looks professional)

## What I Learned 🧠

Building this taught me a lot about:
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For responsive layouts that actually work
- **CSS Animations**: Making things move without being annoying
- **JavaScript Modules**: Organizing code that doesn't suck
- **User Experience**: Making things intuitive for college students
- **Color Theory**: Orange gradients are surprisingly hard to get right

## Future Improvements 🔮

- [ ] Backend integration (probably Node.js + Express)
- [ ] Real user authentication (maybe Firebase?)
- [ ] Database for storing user profiles and matches
- [ ] Push notifications for new matches
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native?)
- [ ] Integration with Spotify API for music taste matching
- [ ] Video chat for virtual jam sessions
