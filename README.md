# Resonance

*A music-focused social platform for RPI students*

## What is Resonance?

Resonance is a web application created to solve a problem that has been frustrating musicians at RPI and that is: finding someone to jam with is much harder than it seems.

At RPI, there are musicians everywhere: performers, composers, and producers, but it's harder to find the right people to play with than it looks. Group chats bury announcements, and replies are unpredictable, making it difficult to match the skill level, genre and availability.

Resonance is a community of musicians who make it all happen in one space: find bandmates and ensembles, post or join practice sessions, organize rehearsals, and work on projects and performances.
Spend less time searching, and more time making music!

## Features:

- **Smart Matching**: AI algorithm that actually matches you with people who share your music taste and availability
- **Post & Find**: Create posts for practice sessions, collaborations, or performances. No more buried messages in group chats!
- **Real-time Chat**: Seamless communication with your matches
- **Event Integration**: Sync with your academic calendar and discover campus events
- **Quiz System**: 2-minute quiz to find your musical "resonance" with other students

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern animations and responsive design
- **Fonts**: Hyperiot (custom display font) + Inter (body text)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Background**: Animated GIF from Giphy
- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript with ES6 imports

## Design Philosophy:

I wanted this to feel like a modern music platform, not just another boring website. So I went with:

- **Vibrant colors**: Orange gradients that pop and feel energetic
- **Custom typography**: Hyperiot font for that futuristic, music-tech vibe
- **Animated backgrounds**: Because static is boring
- **Smooth interactions**: Hover effects, transitions, the works
- **Mobile-first**: Works great on phones

## Key Sections:

- **Hero**: Big, bold "Connect, Collaborate, Create" with animated background
- **Quiz CTA**: "Discover your campus' music scene!" - gets people engaged
- **Problem/Solution**: Explains why Resonance exists and how it helps
- **Features**: Shows off the cool stuff the platform does
- **Login/Signup**: Modal-based authentication (looks professional)

## What I Learned:

Building this taught me a lot about:
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For responsive layouts that actually work
- **CSS Animations**: Making things move without being annoying
- **JavaScript Modules**: Organizing code that doesn't suck
- **User Experience**: Making things intuitive for college students
- **Color Theory**: Orange gradients are surprisingly hard to get right
